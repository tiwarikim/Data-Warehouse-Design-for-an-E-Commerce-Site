# Data-Warehouse-Design-for-an-E-Commerce-Site
A data warehouse is essentially a vast collection of data for a company that assists the company in making educated decisions based on data analysis. The data warehouse designed in this project is a central repository for an e-commerce site, containing unified data ranging from searches to purchases made by site visitors. The site can manage supply based on demand (inventory management), logistics, the price for maximum profitability, and advertisements based on searches and things purchased by establishing such a data warehouse. Recommendations can also be made based on tendencies in a certain area, as well as age groups, sex, and other shared interests. This is a data warehouse implementation for an e-commerce website “Infibeam” which sells digital and consumer electronics.
